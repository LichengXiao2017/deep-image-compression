# Deep Image Compression
An end-to-end tool for extreme image compression using deep learning.

## Motivation for this project format:
- **src* : Put all source code for production within structured directory
- **tests** : Put all source code for testing in an easy to find location
- **configs** : Enable modification of all preset variables within single directory (consisting of one or many config files for separate tasks)
- **data** : Include example a small amount of data in the Github repository so tests can be run to validate installation
- **build** : Include scripts that automate building of a standalone environment
- **static** : Any images or content to include in the README or web framework if part of the pipeline
